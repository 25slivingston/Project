The gnome couple is truely a great choice if you are looking to give the perfect gift. 
You can give them to your grandparents, or you could give them to your best friend as a prank. 
We really don't care, as long as you buy them. In 1882, we had the briliant idea of gluing two gnomes together. 
this was when we created the gnome couple. you can't get more authentic than 1882.  
you really can't. It's really more for your dollar. you should get one today.
