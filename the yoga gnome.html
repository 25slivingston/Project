<p>
The yoga gnome wants to inspire you to be your best self. Whenever you see this calm, beautiful gnome in your garden, you will be reminded that you forgot to meditate that day. 
If you have any animals that visti your garden, they will definatly become best friends with the yoga gnome. 
the chill vibes also work to pasify any hostile intentions meant by passing squirrels, to ensure your garden is not chewed up. 
the yoga gnome is not waterproof, and may evaporate if it is exposed to water or other liquids. 
this may seem like an inconviniance, but we urge you to look past this fact and buy the yoga gnome anyway. Thank you.
